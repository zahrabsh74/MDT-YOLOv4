# YOLO & Monodepth2
Real-time time motorcycle detection and range estimation with MD-TinyYOLOv4 and Monodepth in a single image 

This model is presented for specifically detecting motorcycles with black windshields.

This model was trained using a custom dataset from motorcycles in Tehran's streets.
## Requirements
- Tensorflow
- Opencv
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

## Dataset
the dataset for both motorcycle detection and distance estimation are available in [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZmSOmuEaLK_kwa5fSUrffk7FnxaQrXTr?usp=drive_link) 
## Result
